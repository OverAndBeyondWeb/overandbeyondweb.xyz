        	<h1>About the Designer/Developer</h1>
          <p>Hi, my name is Juan Fox. I am a web designer and developer residing in Charlotte, North Carolina.  I grew up very interested in art and design, as well as architecture and engineering.  I majored in mechanical engineering at N.C. A&T State University, and have also taken classes in design, computer science, and business. I have acquired a wide range of skills that allow me to tackle many different challenges and accomplish all of the goals set before me.  As a proud member of the web development community, my mission is to deliver a product that is attractively designed, easily managed, and comfortably navigated.  I can achieve this every time because I continue to educate myself on new and existing technologies, standards, and practices.  I will always dedicate the bulk of my time, through endless effort and calculated thought, to the satisfaction of my client.
